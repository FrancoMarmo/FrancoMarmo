### Hi, im Franco ðŸ‘‹
As a Full-Stack Developer, I turn ideas into code. I am capable of handling any obstacles, challenges or problems. Being a focused and disciplined person make me a wise choice. Using React/Next for the Frontend and Node, Express and SQL/NoSQL databases for the Backend, I am able to make attractive, interactive, useful and professional websites. In my free time, I love reading, going to the gym and trekking in the woods. I think being in peace with myself is a very important aspect when it comes to working in an efficient and tidy way.
